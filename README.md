# 🖼️ Image Forgery Detection  

## 🔍 Overview  
This project aims to detect forged images using a deep learning-based **Discriminator model**. It classifies images as **authentic** or **forged** by analyzing features extracted from the image. The model is trained on real and manipulated images and deployed using **Flask** for easy interaction.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Deep Learning Model** – Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze image authenticity.  
✅ **Forgery Probability** – Provides a probability score indicating the likelihood of an image being forged.  
✅ **Batch Processing** – Supports analysis of multiple images in a directory.  
✅ **Flask API Integration** – Easily interact with the model via a simple web interface.  
✅ **Confidence-Based Prediction** – Classifies images as "Highly Likely Forged," "Likely Forged," "Likely Authentic," or "Highly Likely Authentic."

## 🛠️ Installation  

### 🔹 Prerequisites  
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed, along with the necessary dependencies.  

### 🔹 Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔹 Download Pretrained Model  
Place the **discriminator.pth** file in the `model/` directory.  

## 🖼️ Usage  

### 🔹 Single Image Detection  
```python
from utils.inference import detect_image_forgery

result = detect_image_forgery("model/discriminator.pth", "test_image.jpg")
print(result)
```

### 🔹 Batch Processing for a Directory  
```python
from utils.inference import analyze_directory

results, summary = analyze_directory("model/discriminator.pth", "test_images/")
print(summary)
```

### 🔹 Run Flask App for Web Interface  
```bash
python app/app.py
```
Then open **http://127.0.0.1:5000** in your browser to upload images and check for forgery.  

## 🏗️ Model Training (Optional)  
To train the model on a custom dataset:  
```bash
python model/train.py --dataset /path/to/dataset --epochs 10
```
